# Disease-Prediction-Model
This is disease prediciton model using a dataset created by the university of columbia. The two main classifiers used in order to predict the disease from the symptoms are MnB and Random Forest. I also used a logistic regression in order to predict the probability. This model was then deployed to a local developement server using flask.
